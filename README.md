I don't know if anyone will see this, but I will just say again. In my code, I mentioned that I couldn't use a function since, 
when I put my code under the whole function, it didn't work as in, I create a function and simply copy-paste my code into it, my code didn't work.
Secondly, I tried to call a function and that didn't work either.
